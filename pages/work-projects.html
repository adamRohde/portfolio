							<p>The above picture shows the type of hardware I have been working with for the past 13 years. Because this hardware isn't familiar to most people I will give quick descriptions so give better context to the type of programming I have been doing for the past 13 years. </p>
							<ul class="components-list">
								<li>
									<b>Programmable Logic Controller (PLC)</b>.  It is the brains for most industrial machinery.  Code is written to this device so that the machine becomes automated. The languages used for PLCs varies from vendor to vendor.  I have the most experience with a language called Structured Text which is definied within the IEC 61131.  This language borrows it's syntax from Pascal.
								</li>
								<br>
								<li>
									<b>HMI (Human Machine Interface)</b>.  It is the interface for the operator of the machine.  Historically the GUIs for HMIs have been written with native development environments created by the vendor of the HMI.  Recently there has been a trend towards using more open source web technologies to  create these interfaces
								</li>
								<br>
								<li>
									<b>Servo Drive/Amplifier</b>. These are used to control electric servo motors (4) which are capable of following precise motion trajectories.  Position data is fead back to them via the orange cable so the drive knows exactly where the motor is at all times
								</li>
								<br>
								<li>
									<b>Servo Motor</b>.  These motors allow for precision motion control.  They are used in many applications like robotics, machines tool (CNC) and different types of roll feed applications, for example printing lines.
